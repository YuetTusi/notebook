## 自由派让美国变得像朝鲜？当脱北者成为美国右翼盟友

[A North Korean Dissident Defects to the American Right](https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20230704/yeonmi-park-north-korea-republicans/dual/)

“The first thing my mom taught me as a young girl living in North Korea was don’t even whisper, because birds and mice could hear me,” Yeonmi Park told the audience that had come to hear her speak in Queens.

>“作为一个生活在朝鲜的小女孩，妈妈教我的第一件事就是连悄悄话都不要说，因为鸟儿和老鼠都能听到我的声音，”朴研美对前来皇后区听她演讲的观众说。

“This is what dictators do: they plant a `spike` everywhere, a distrust between people, a `distrust` between family, even. The teachers tell their children,” she went on, “‘If your parents say one wrong thing, come to tell the teacher.’”

>“这就是独裁者所做的：他们四处埋下猜忌的种子，人与人之间、甚至家人之间都存在不信任。老师告诉他们的孩子，”她继续说道，“‘如果你的父母说了不该说的，就来告诉老师。’”

It was a story that Ms. Park has told often, on television sets and `conference` stages and in a best-selling `memoir`, over the `decade` she has spent as one of the world’s most famous `defectors` from the Kim family's isolated totalitarian state.

> 在电视上、会议的舞台上和畅销回忆录中，朴研美多次讲过这个故事，十年来，她一直是世界上最著名的脱北者之一，逃离了金氏家族的孤立极权国家。

But in recent years, she has added a new postscript.

> 但在最近几年里，她又增添了新的后记。

“And now,” she told the crowd in Long Island City last weekend, “I see the same thing in America.”

> “现在，”她上周末在长岛对观众说，“我在美国看到了同样的事情。”

`Conservative` pundits and politicians have long warned that liberal economics and cultural politics would set the United States on the road to `leftist` authoritarianism. But until two years ago, they had never had an ally quite like Ms. Park. A `refugee` from the world’s most infamous surviving Stalinist state, Ms. Park, 29, claims to back up those worst fears with firsthand experience: comparing calls to dismantle racism in math `instruction`, for instance, with lessons she received as a child in North Korean schools.

> 保守派专家和政治家长期以来一直警告说，自由主义经济和文化政治将使美国走上左翼威权主义道路。但他们还从未有过像朴研美这样的盟友，直到两年前。29岁的朴研美是来自朝鲜的难民，这是世界遗留的最臭名昭著的斯大林主义国家。她声称自己的亲身经历证实了这些最可怕的恐惧：例如，她将在数学教学中消除种族主义的呼吁与她小时候在朝鲜学校接受的课程进行比较。

Describing her own `recent` experience as an undergraduate at Columbia University, Ms. Park told the Fox News host Mark Levin in an interview last month that the school’s pedagogy “is exactly what the North Korean `regime` used to brainwash people.” Left-wing indoctrination in American educational institutions, she said, “is, I think, the biggest `threat` that our nation, and our civilization is facing.”

> 在上个月接受福克斯新闻主持人马克·莱文采访时，朴研美描述了自己前几年在哥伦比亚大学读本科的经历，称该校的教学法“正是朝鲜政权用来给人们洗脑的方法”。她说，“我认为”，美国教育机构中的左翼思想灌输“是我们国家和我们文明面临的最大威胁”。

She now denounces Hillary Clinton, with whom she once shared a conference stage, as an “absolute faker and liar,” and `rails` against transgender-oriented marketing campaigns: “Political correctness has erased women,” she wrote recently on Facebook.

> 她现在谴责曾与她同台演讲的希拉里·克林顿是“彻头彻尾的骗子和说谎者”，并抨击以跨性别者为导向的营销活动：“政治正确已经抹杀了女性，”她最近在脸书上写道。

Underscoring it all is the warning that these complaints add up to something `vastly` more `sinister` than the sum of their Fox News chyrons. “I think so many people in America think that somehow America is `immune` to `tyranny`, and somehow a `dictatorship` begins like North Korea,” she said at the Queens event, hosted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA. “It didn’t begin there. It began with amazing promises of `equity`. They promised a socialist `paradise` to us.”

> 这一切都是在强调警告，这些不满加起来比在福克斯新闻里讲述的一切加起来都要更加险恶。“我认为很多美国人都认为，美国不知何故对暴政是免疫的，而且独裁政权是像朝鲜那样开始的，”她在皇后区由保守派组织“美国转折点”主办的一个活动上说。“但事情不是那样开始的。它始于令人惊叹的平等承诺。他们向我们许诺了一个社会主义天堂。”

---

“And with that promise,” she added, “they took everything, one by one, from us.” The crowd gave her two standing ovations.

> “有了这个承诺，”她还说，“他们从我们这里一点一点拿走了一切。”人群两次起立为她鼓掌。

Ms. Park’s transformation from celebrity defector to loud critic of liberal identity politics is extraordinarily rare. Very few of the tens of thousands of people who have fled North Korea wade into domestic politics in the countries where they have taken refuge.

> 朴研美从脱北名人转变为自由身份政治的大声批评者，这是极其罕见的。在数万名逃离朝鲜的人中，很少有人涉足庇护国的国内政治。

But in an American political climate that rewards hyperbole and alarm, Ms. Park, who became a U.S. citizen in 2021, has found a lucrative niche.

> 但在鼓励夸大其词和散播担忧的美国政治气候下，于2021年成为美国公民的朴研美找到了有利可图的一席之地。

Her second book, “While Time Remains,” a self-described “warning for Americans” published in February, has already outpaced the hardcover sales of her best-selling 2015 memoir. She is a regular guest on popular right-leaning TV networks and podcasts, and speaker at conservative universities and think tanks.

> 她的第二本书《趁还有时间》(While Time Remains)于2月出版，她自称这是“对美国人的警告”，其销量已经超过了她2015年的畅销回忆录的精装本。她是热门右倾电视网络和播客的常客，也是保守派大学和智囊团的演讲者。

This spring, she became a contributor to Turning Point USA, appearing at its conferences alongside figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and [James O’Keefe, the right-wing activist](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/us/politics/james-okeefe-project-veritas.html "Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/us/politics/james-okeefe-project-veritas.html") recently ousted from Project Veritas.

> 今年春天，她成为“美国转折点”的演讲者，与佐治亚州众议员马乔里·泰勒·格林和最近被驱逐出“真理计划”的右翼活动家[詹姆斯·奥基夫](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/us/politics/james-okeefe-project-veritas.html)等人物一起出席该会议。

Her recent trajectory has drawn winces from some past allies and supporters, who worry about the toll that her dive into the American culture wars may take on her effectiveness as a human rights advocate. And some observers of her career, noting her history of reinvention and questions raised about the accuracy of her account, have lifted an eyebrow at her latest act.

> 她最近的变化引起了一些过去盟友和支持者的退缩，他们担心她卷入美国文化战争可能会影响她作为人权倡导者的效果。一些关注她职业生涯的观察人士注意到她曾经重塑过去的经历，并对她叙述的准确性提出质疑，他们对她最近的行为感到惊讶。

“She’s an amazing entertainer,” said Jay Song, a professor of Korean studies at the Asia Institute of the University of Melbourne in Australia, who studies the experiences of North Korean defectors. “She’s very smart. She’s always picking up on keywords.”

> “她是一位了不起的表演者，”澳大利亚研究脱北者经历的墨尔本大学亚洲研究所朝鲜研究教授杰伊·宋说。“她非常聪明。她总是在关键词上做文章。”

### A Celebrity Defector (脱北名人)

In a recent interview, Ms. Park, who now lives in New York, described her own politics as less strident than they often appear in her media appearances. “I support gay marriage, I’m very socially liberal,” she said. “I never thought I was a conservative.” Asked whether she identifies as such now, she said no.

> 现居纽约的朴研美在最近的一次采访中表示，她自己的政治观点并不像她在媒体上经常表现的那样强烈。“我支持同性婚姻，在社会方面非常自由主义，”她说。“我从没想过自己是一个保守派。”当被问及她现在是否认同自己是保守派时，她予以否认。

She likened the initial idea for her second book to Alexis de Tocqueville. “He comes from France to America — to American democracy,” she said. “So, like, what if a North Korean sees America and analyzes America?”

> 她将第二本书的创作初衷比作亚历克西斯·德·托克维尔。“他从法国来到美国——研究美国民主，”她说。“那么，如果是一个朝鲜人看到美国并分析美国呢？”

Ms. Park has lived most of her adult life in the glare of media scrutiny, in one form or another. Five years after escaping North Korea with her mother in 2007, at age 13, she was cast on “[Now On My Way to Meet You](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/magazine/korea-tv-reunification.html),” a popular variety show on South Korean television starring young women who had defected.

> 朴研美成年后的大部分时间都生活在媒体以某种形式的审视之下。2007年，13岁的她与母亲一起逃离朝鲜，五年后，她参加了韩国电视台热门综艺节目《[现在去见你](https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20190531/korea-tv-reunification/)》，主角是年轻的女脱北者。

The program, which premiered in 2011, made North Koreans newly visible in South Korean popular culture. Ms. Park was one of its biggest stars, an effervescent personality who described her North Korean family as relatively affluent and was nicknamed “the Paris Hilton of North Korea.”

> 该节目于2011年首播，使朝鲜人在韩国的流行文化中获得了新的关注。朴研美是节目里最耀眼的明星之一，她性格开朗，形容自己的朝鲜家庭相对富裕，被称为“朝鲜的帕丽斯·希尔顿”。

“I think a lot of South Koreans learned a lot from that show,” said Jean H. Lee, a journalist who reported from both North and South Korea for The Associated Press. “But it also created the celebrity defector culture.”

> “我认为很多韩国人从那个节目中学到了很多东西，”为美联社提供朝鲜和韩国报道的记者吉恩·H·李说。“但它也创造了名人脱北者文化。”

In 2014, Ms. Park was invited to speak at the One Young World conference in Dublin, where she revealed a far darker story of her life in North Korea and of her escape.

> 2014年，朴研美受邀在都柏林举行的世界青年领袖峰会上演讲，讲述了自己在朝鲜的生活以及逃亡过程中更加黑暗的故事。

Amid sobs, she said her mother had been raped by the human trafficker who brought them across the border into China, and described a flight on foot across the Gobi Desert into Mongolia. Later, she would say that she herself had been sold as a teenager to a Chinese husband. She had to work in an adult online chat room, she said, before she and her mother escaped from China.

> 她抽泣着说，她的母亲被带着她们穿越边境进入中国的人贩子强奸了，并描述了她徒步穿越戈壁沙漠进入蒙古的经历。后来，她说自己十几岁的时候就被卖给了一个中国男人做妻子。她说，在和母亲逃离中国之前，她不得不在成人在线聊天室工作。

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei-gGvLWOZI) of her short speech — a horrific story delivered by a slight 21-year-old woman, wearing a traditional [hanbok](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/style/one-garments-journey-through-history.html) dress and trembling with emotion — went viral, making Ms. Park an international humanitarian celebrity. Within months she had a book deal with Penguin Random House for a memoir written with Maryanne Vollers, Hillary Clinton’s ghostwriter.

> 朴研美的简短演讲[视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei-gGvLWOZI)在网上广泛传播，视频中一位21岁的瘦小女性穿着[传统朝鲜服饰](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/style/one-garments-journey-through-history.html)，声泪俱下、颤抖着讲述了一个可怕的故事，这让朴研美成为了国际人道主义名人。几个月内，她与企鹅兰登书屋签订了一份与玛丽安·沃勒斯共同撰写回忆录的出书协议，后者是希拉里·克林顿的代笔作家。

There were some noted inconsistencies among the stories Ms. Park had told to her South Korean audience and the ones she [now told](https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a16414/yeonmi-park-escape-from-north-korea/). Mary Ann Jolley, an Australian journalist, published a [detailed account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD44psFn-nI) of conflicting and implausible details, from the government atrocities she described to the geographical details of her escape, her father’s death in China and her experience in detention in Mongolia.

> 朴研美向韩国观众讲述的故事和[如今讲述的故事](https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a16414/yeonmi-park-escape-from-north-korea/)之间存在一些明显的不一致。澳大利亚记者玛丽·安·乔利[详细报道](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD44psFn-nI)了相互矛盾且不合情理的细节，从她描述的政府暴行到逃亡的地理细节、父亲在中国的死亡以及她在蒙古被拘留的经历。

Ms. Park has disputed some of Ms. Jolley’s criticisms but acknowledged others. Some were a result of language difficulties, she said, or the effects of trauma. She said others stemmed from liberties producers took with her identity on the show in South Korea.

> 朴研美对乔利的一些批评提出了异议，但也承认了其他批评。她说，有些是由于语言上的困难或创伤的影响所致。她说，还有一些是源于韩国节目制作人对她身份的随意利用。

### Disenchanted With the Gala Circuit (对精英不再抱幻想)

When she wrote her first book, Ms. Park and her publisher were mindful of the skepticism Ms. Jolley’s article generated, she said. Both she and Ms. Vollers have [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector) they corroborated as much of the story as possible with interviews with family members and fellow defectors.

> 朴研美说，写第一本书时，她和出版商注意到了乔利的文章引发的怀疑。她和沃勒斯都[表示](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector)，她们通过对家人和其他脱北者的采访，尽可能多地证实了她的故事。

“In Order to Live” has sold more than 130,000 copies in hardcover and paperback combined, according to Circana BookScan. Ms. Park was showered with media attention, and she fielded invitations to private retreats hosted by Jeff Bezos and [took selfies](https://www.facebook.com/officialyeonmipark/photos/a.834011640050263/1817628525021898/) with Scarlett Johansson. She [attended the Met Gala](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/fashion/joe-gebbia-yeonmi-park-met-gala.html) with Joe Gebbia, an Airbnb founder, and shared a speaking stage (at an event in partnership with The New York Times) with Mrs. Clinton, who looked her in the eye after her speech and “promised she would do everything in her power to help the women of North Korea,” Ms. Park later wrote. (Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said neither Mrs. Clinton nor her staff who were present at the time recalled Mrs. Clinton saying that.)

> 根据Circana Book Scan的数据，《为了活下去》的精装和平装本销量总计超过13万册。朴研美受到了媒体的广泛关注，她收到了杰夫·贝索斯举办的私人聚会的邀请，并与斯嘉丽·约翰逊一起[自拍](https://www.facebook.com/officialyeonmipark/photos/a.834011640050263/1817628525021898/)。她与爱彼迎创始人乔·杰比亚一起[参加了Met Gala](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/fashion/joe-gebbia-yeonmi-park-met-gala.html)，并与希拉里同台演讲（那是一次《纽约时报》共同承办的活动），朴研美后来写道，希拉里·克林顿在演讲后看着她的眼睛，“承诺她会竭尽全力帮助朝鲜妇女”。（希拉里的发言人尼克·梅里尔表示，希拉里及其当时在场的工作人员都不记得她说过这句话。）

In her new book, however, Ms. Park writes about being disenchanted by her brush with elites. They were more interested in emotional gratification than in action, she came to believe.

> 然而，在她的新书中，朴研美写到，与精英的接触令她失望。她开始相信，他们更感兴趣的是情感上的满足，而不是行动。

She began studying at Columbia University in 2016 and majored in human rights, in hopes of becoming a professional advocate. But some people who encountered her at the time recalled that she seemed to struggle with the transition from celebrity dissident to more policy-focused activism.

> 2016年，她开始在哥伦比亚大学学习人权专业，希望成为一名专业倡导者。但当时遇到她的一些人回忆说，她从一名持不同政见的名人转变为更关注政策的激进主义者的过程似乎并不顺利。

She tried to lend her star power to a group called Freedom for North Korea, which raised money for a sister organization in South Korea that rescued North Korean refugees from China — her personal passion. But Jin Park, a former human rights activist who worked with her in the group at the time, said Ms. Park was unsuccessful in the role and soon moved on.

> 她试图用自己的明星影响力来帮助一个名为“朝鲜自由”的组织，该组织为韩国的一个姐妹组织筹集资金，后者从中国救出朝鲜难民——这是她个人喜欢做的事情。但当时与她一起在该组织工作的前人权活动人士朴镇（音）说，朴研美没能胜任这个角色，很快就离开了。

“We thought that she could be a good fund-raiser because of her connections and networks,” he said. “I think she tried, but getting people’s money is not as easy as it sounds.” (Ms. Park says she quickly learned she was too busy for the role at the time.)

 > “我们认为她可能是一个很好的筹款人，因为她有人脉和网络，”他说。“我想她努力过了，但是向别人要钱并不像听起来那么容易。”（朴研美说，她很快意识到自己当时太忙了，不适合这个角色。）

Shortly after graduating in 2020, Ms. Park was assaulted and robbed of her wallet while out walking with her son in Chicago. As she used her cellphone to record her assailant, a Black woman, she said another woman shouted at her for doing so and called her a racist. (The assailant was later arrested and pleaded guilty to unlawful restraint, according to court records.)  

> 2020年毕业后不久，朴研美和儿子在芝加哥散步时遭到袭击，钱包被抢。她说，当她用手机录下袭击她的一名黑人女性时，另一名女性对她大吼大叫，还说她是种族主义者。（法庭记录显示，袭击者后来被捕，并承认犯有非法拘禁罪。）

The incident, she wrote, was a turning point in her own politics, “a sign of how far advanced the woke disease really was in America by that point, and how inhumane it was making otherwise normal people.” She began to seek out allies who felt similarly.

> 她写道，该事件成为她政治生涯的一个转折点，“这表明当时‘觉醒’这种疾病在美国已经发展到了多么严重的程度，它使原本正常的人变得多么不人道。”她开始寻找志同道合的盟友。

After reading a book by Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and popular conservative media personality, she sought out his daughter, Mikhaila, a podcaster and social-media lifestyle influencer, who invited her on her podcast. Hearing that Mr. Peterson was a collector of Soviet art, Ms. Park sent him a North Korean postcard she had saved.

> 在读完加拿大心理学家、颇受欢迎的保守派媒体人乔丹·彼得森的一本书后，她找到了他的女儿米哈伊拉，她是一名播客主播，也是社交媒体上的生活方式网红；米哈伊拉邀请她上自己的播客。听说彼得森是苏联艺术品的收藏家，朴研美给他寄了一张自己保存的朝鲜明信片。

Mr. Peterson invited her on his podcast, where she described her experience at Columbia. The interview led to a flurry of conservative media attention and, shortly thereafter, a $500,000 book deal with Threshold Editions, Simon & Schuster’s conservative imprint. Mr. Peterson wrote the book’s foreword.

> 彼得森邀请她上自己的播客，她在播客中讲述了自己在哥伦比亚大学的经历。这次采访引起了保守派媒体的关注，此后不久，西蒙与舒斯特旗下的保守派出版社Threshold Editions以50万美元的价格与她签下了一份出版协议。彼得森为这本书写了前言。

## ‘It’s a Free Society’“这是个自由社会”

Ms. Park maintains that her recent outspokenness has cost, not made, her money. The advance for “While Time Remains,” while significant, was well short of the $1.1 million she received for her previous book. Invitations for well-paying corporate speaking events that used to make up much of her income have slowed to a trickle, she said.

> 朴研美始终认为，近来的直言不讳让她付出了代价，而不是赚到了钱。《趁还有时间》收到的预付款虽然可观，但远低于她前一本书得到的110万美元。她说报酬不菲的企业演讲活动邀请如今已经少得可怜，这些活动收入曾占她收入的很大一部分。

She now earns $6,600 a month from Turning Point USA, she said, and maintains a busy itinerary of talks before other conservative audiences who are more eager to hear her warnings about “cancel culture” and “woke” identity politics. After a recent talk in Brookfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, a local school board member, Sam Hughes, [posted on Facebook](https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/west/2023/03/22/elmbrook-school-board-candidate-compares-equity-to-north-korean-abuse/70034058007/ "Link: https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/west/2023/03/22/elmbrook-school-board-candidate-compares-equity-to-north-korean-abuse/70034058007/") about the power of Ms. Park’s presentation.

> 她说自己现在每个月能从“美国转折点”赚到6600美元，面向保守派的演讲也让她保持着繁忙的演讲日程，这些受众更乐于听到她关于“取消文化”和“觉醒”身份政治的警告。最近她在威斯康辛州密尔沃基市郊区布鲁克菲尔德的一场演讲结束后，当地学校董事会成员萨姆·休斯[在Facebook发文](https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/west/2023/03/22/elmbrook-school-board-candidate-compares-equity-to-north-korean-abuse/70034058007/)描绘了朴研美演讲所传递的力量。

“The North Korean regime created schools not to teach children how to think, but what to believe,” Mr. Hughes wrote, warning about the dangers “groupthink and collectivism.” Considering his district’s equity programs, “North Korea’s example should come to mind,” he wrote.

> “朝鲜政权建立学校不是为了教孩子如何思考，而是对他们进行信仰的灌输，”休斯写道，他还指出了“群体思维与集体主义”的危险性。鉴于他所在地区实施的平等教育计划，“应该让人联想到朝鲜的例子”，他写道。

Ms. Park, for her part, suggested that her latest turn might not be her last.

> 朴研美则表示，她最新的立场转变或许不会是最后一次。

“I might write a completely different book in five years,” she said. “I might say everything that I wrote in the second book was dumb. But that’s O.K.”

> “五年后我可能会写一本全然不同的作品，”她说。“我可能会说，我在第二本书里写的一切都很蠢。但没关系。”

She laughed. “It’s a free society,” she said.

> 她笑了。“这是个自由社会嘛，”她说。
