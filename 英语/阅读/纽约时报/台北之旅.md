在台北火车站，一位名叫翠翠（音）的中国人权活动人士羡慕地看着六位年轻的台湾政治人物正在竞选台北市议会席位。十年前，他们曾同时参与民主抗议活动——她在中国，而那六位台湾人则在台湾海峡的对岸。

“We came of age as activists around the same time. Now they’re running as legislators while my **peers** and I are in **exile**,” said Cuicui, who fled China for Southeast Asia last year over security **concerns**.

“我们是同时代的行动者。现在他们在选议员，我和同伴们却在流亡，”翠翠说，她在去年出于安全考虑从中国逃至东南亚。
```

The women went to **election** rallies and talked to politicians and voters, as well as homeless people and other **disadvantaged** groups. They attended a stand-up **comedy show** by a man from China, now living in Taiwan, whose humor addressed topics that are taboo in his home country.

> election n. 选举

她们去了选举集会，与政客和选民交谈，还接触了无家可归者和其他弱势群体。她们看了一位来自中国大陆、现居台湾人士的脱口秀表演，幽默调侃了在他的祖国属于禁忌的话题。
