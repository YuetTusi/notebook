Do you hear the people sing?  
Singing the song of angry men?  
It is the music of the people  
Who will not be slaves again!  
When the beating of your heart  
`Echoes` the beating of the `drums`  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes!

> echo (n.) 回声，回响

Will you join in our `crusade`?  
Who will be strong and stand with me?  
Beyond the `barricade`  
Is there a world you long to see?

> crusade (n.) /kruːˈseɪd/ 斗争，运动

> barricade (n.) /ˌbærɪ'keɪd/ 路障，街垒

Then join in the fight  
That will give you the right to be free!

Who will not be slaves again!  
When the beating of your heart  
Echoes the beating of the drums  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes!

Will you give all you can give  
So that our `banner` may advance?  
Some will fall and some will live  
Will you stand up and take your chance?  
The blood of the `martyrs`  
Will water the `meadows` of France!
