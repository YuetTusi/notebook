A restaurant in Sichuan, China, has challenged its customers to eat that many wonton dumplings as quickly as possible, in what it's called the "king of big stomach" challenge.

But when the Chinese authorities heard about the challenge, they weren't happy.

According to CNN, the challenge could break China's anti-food waste law. The unnamed restaurant is one of several restaurants in the area that is being investigated by the authorities because of competitions like this, CNN reported.

Food eating competitions are popular in Western countries but are not encouraged in China, where about 45 million were killed in the Great Chinese Famine between 1959 and 1961 — one of the **deadliest** famines in history.

According to a law that was introduced in 2021, restaurants can be fined up to 10,000 yuan — or about $1,380 — for actions that may cause "**obvious**" waste.

President Xi Jinping has spoken against food waste in the past. In 2020, he **reintroduced** the "Clean Plate Campaign," to encourage people to order only as much food as they will eat and reduce how much food they waste.

------

`fine`最常见做为形容词，表示我很好`I'm fine.`。但做为名词使用，`fine`有罚金之意，如：`A parking fine`（停车罚款）。

`yet`副词意为“还...”，这个单词只能用于否定和疑问句中：`I didn't receive a letter from him yet.`（我还没有收到他的来信）

`as ... as`表示“和...一样”：`He doesn't earn as much as me.`（他挣得没有我多）
