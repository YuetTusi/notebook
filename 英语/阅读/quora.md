The most famous dictionary of Chinese is the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716, which has 50,000 characters. About 40 percent of these characters are minor `variants`. Many more are `obscure` and one-use forms.

> variant （名词） 变种；变体
> 
> obscure（形容词）费解的；难以理解的

Besides Kangxi, there is also Hanyu Da Cidian (漢語大詞典, 1986–1994). It’s a Classical Chinese dictionary that `leaves out` the obscure variants that fill Kangxi. It has 23,000 characters.

> leave out 略去

In addition to the traditional characters, there are 2,135 simplified characters.

A dictionary of modern Chinese `typically` has about 13,000 characters.

> typically （副词）通常；一般

China’s Ministry of Education has of list of 3,500 “Type I” characters, `supposedly` for daily use, `as well as` 3,000 less common “Type II” characters. That’s a total of 6,500 characters.

> supposedly （副词）据说，suppose 为动词词形式
>
> as well as 即...又

The second edition of Hanyu Dazidian, published in 2010, has 60,370 characters. This is the 2006 edition of Hanyu Dazidian:


There are 65,941 Chinese characters in Unicode, according to Wikipedia. The Unicode list is based on Hanyu Dazidian.

## Why do Chinese people allow an obvious dictator like Xi Jinping to rule?

[原文](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Chinese-people-allow-an-obvious-dictator-like-Xi-Jinping-to-rule)

There is Democracy within the Chinese system. Anyone can be `elected` to local district level, city, provincial and central government.

Xi is a `figurehead` and the work done to improve China is done by millions, including many highly skilled and `intelligent` engineers, scientists and other technically qualified people.

> figurehead （名词）傀儡
> 
> intelligent（形容词）有才知的；聪明的

Why do the Chinese allow? Well over the last few decades China has gone from a `famine ridden`, `agrarian society` to a highly advanced nation with a well off agrarian society (much better than ever before), and hi tech cities with the best `infrastructure` in the world. It is now the largest economy in the world. There is a `massive` growing middle class and rich class and the blue collar workers live better than ever. Poverty is being `eradicated` and they have universal health care and `pensions` and the future looks good. Of course there are problems.

> famine ridden 充满饥荒
> 
> agrarian society 农业社会 agrarian为形容词，农业的
> 
> infrastructure（名词）基础建设
> 
>massive（形容词）巨大的；非常严重的
> 
> eradicate（动词）根除；消灭
> 
> pension（名词）津贴；养老金

What of your “chosen” leaders? If you are from the US; they have to be billionaires to afford the `election` costs, `influence` the media and they have to `obey` the real leaders; the Military Industrial Complex and major corporations. What do they really do for ordinary people?

>election（名词）选举
>
>influence （及物动词）影响
>
>obey（及物动词）服从

US people need to do some basic research about China and look at the realities at home before they decide to hawk on a nation they have completely zero understanding of. I notice Americans try and focus on any problem within China and ignore the massive problems in the US and also the massive problems the US causes to people from all over the world with their `interference`. Millions of people on this planet, including me, have `suffered` because of US Foreign `Policy`. We can't elect US leaders, but the US has influence over our lives; unfortunately. So why should anyone, outside the USA put up with the obvious global dictatorship of the USA?

> interference （名词）干涉；介入
> 
> suffer （动词）受苦
> 
> policy（名词）政策

## Do most Chinese people want to go to war and invade peaceful Taiwan, or is it just their power crazed dictator?

[原文](https://www.quora.com/Do-most-Chinese-people-want-to-go-to-war-and-invade-peaceful-Taiwan-or-is-it-just-their-power-crazed-dictator)

> 是大多数中国人想要入侵台湾，还只是一个疯狂独裁者的想法？

Official Chinese textbooks `view` the issues of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as `colonial` problems left over from `imperialism`. The official attitude is that these are China's core `territories` , and China hopes for peaceful `unification`. However, due to Taiwan's unique historical reasons, the people of Taiwan do not have the same sense of Chinese identity as Hong Kong and Macao. Many Chinese believe that completing the peaceful unification of Taiwan will only become more and more difficult (I also think so), and calls for unification by force are growing.

> view （动词）把...视为

> colonial （形容词）殖民的

> imperialism （名词）帝国主义

> territory （名词）领土

> unification （名词）统一，动词形式为：unify

For example, if Germany wanted to recover the former `territory` of East Prussia (*东普鲁士*) now, it would be impossible. `In short`, due to changes over time, the task of reclaiming lost territories is becoming increasingly `unrealistic`. Taiwan has developed its own distinct identity and political system over `decades` of separation from the mainland. Views on unification have diverged greatly across the strait, and unification cannot be `achieved` with the `consent` of both sides. Using military means will only worsen cross-strait relations (*两岸关系*) and destabilize the region.

> in short 简而言之


> unrealistic （形容词）不切实际的


> decade （名词）十年，十年间


> achieve （动词）完成


> consent （不及物动词）同意

The Chinese government views Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as its `sovereign` territories. However, the complicated historical realities mean that the majority populations of Taiwan in particular do not necessarily identify themselves as Chinese or support unification with China. Forcing the issue risks `conflict`, and peaceful options for bringing Taiwan under China's sovereignty while respecting the island's autonomy and democratic system have yet to be developed. The situation `remains` unresolved and is still the subject of `debate` and `contention`.

> sovereign （名词）元首；君主
> 
> conflict （名词）冲突
> 
> remain （动词）仍然...； 保持...不变
> 
> debate （不及物动词）辩论
> 
> contention （名词）争论
