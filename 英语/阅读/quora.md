The most famous dictionary of Chinese is the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716, which has 50,000 characters. About 40 percent of these characters are minor `variants`. Many more are `obscure` and one-use forms.

> variant （名词） 变种；变体
> 
> obscure（形容词）费解的；难以理解的

Besides Kangxi, there is also Hanyu Da Cidian (漢語大詞典, 1986–1994). It’s a Classical Chinese dictionary that `leaves out` the obscure variants that fill Kangxi. It has 23,000 characters.

> leave out 略去

In addition to the traditional characters, there are 2,135 simplified characters.

A dictionary of modern Chinese `typically` has about 13,000 characters.

> typically （副词）通常；一般

China’s Ministry of Education has of list of 3,500 “Type I” characters, `supposedly` for daily use, `as well as` 3,000 less common “Type II” characters. That’s a total of 6,500 characters.

The second edition of Hanyu Dazidian, published in 2010, has 60,370 characters. This is the 2006 edition of Hanyu Dazidian:


There are 65,941 Chinese characters in Unicode, according to Wikipedia. The Unicode list is based on Hanyu Dazidian.

## Why do Chinese people allow an obvious dictator like Xi Jinping to rule?

[原文](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Chinese-people-allow-an-obvious-dictator-like-Xi-Jinping-to-rule)

There is Democracy within the Chinese system. Anyone can be *elected* to local district level, city, provincial and central government.

Xi is a *figurehead* and the work done to improve China is done by millions, including many highly skilled and *intelligent* engineers, scientists and other technically qualified people.

> figurehead （名词）傀儡
> 
> intelligent（形容词）有才知的；聪明的

Why do the Chinese allow? Well over the last few decades China has gone from a *famine ridden*, *agrarian society* to a highly advanced nation with a well off agrarian society (much better than ever before), and hi tech cities with the best *infrastructure* in the world. It is now the largest economy in the world. There is a *massive* growing middle class and rich class and the blue collar workers live better than ever. Poverty is being *eradicated* and they have universal health care and *pensions* and the future looks good. Of course there are problems.

> famine ridden 充满饥荒
> 
> agrarian society 农业社会 agrarian为形容词，农业的
> 
> infrastructure（名词）基础建设
> 
>massive（形容词）巨大的；非常严重的
> 
> eradicate（动词）根除；消灭
> 
> pension（名词）津贴；养老金

What of your “chosen” leaders? If you are from the US; they have to be billionaires to afford the *election* costs, *influence* the media and they have to *obey* the real leaders; the Military Industrial Complex and major corporations. What do they really do for ordinary people?

>election（名词）选举
>
>influence （及物动词）影响
>
>obey（及物动词）服从

US people need to do some basic research about China and look at the realities at home before they decide to hawk on a nation they have completely zero understanding of. I notice Americans try and focus on any problem within China and ignore the massive problems in the US and also the massive problems the US causes to people from all over the world with their *interference*. Millions of people on this planet, including me, have *suffered* because of US Foreign *Policy*. We can't elect US leaders, but the US has influence over our lives; unfortunately. So why should anyone, outside the USA put up with the obvious global dictatorship of the USA?

> interference （名词）干涉；介入

> suffer （动词）受苦
> 
> policy（名词）政策
