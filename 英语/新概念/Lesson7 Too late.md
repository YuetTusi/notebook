## 课文

`The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning.`

过去进行时，表示过去某个时间正在发生的动作。此处用来形容侦探在那一天等飞机用了整整一天。

`They were expecting a valuable parcel`

expect v. 期待。 即可接人也可接事：

expect visitors 期待客人； expect a rise price 期待价格上涨

`thieves would try to steal the diamonds` （在过去时间）要偷钻石

过去将来时。在过去时间将要发生的动作。

形式为`would do`或`was/were going to do`

`someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds.`

由that引导的宾语从句。

简单句中的句子成分都由一个词语组成，而复合句则由另一个句子充当主句的一个成分，而宾语从句就是说，“宾语”由一个句字组成。

tell sb. sth.是双宾结构，告诉某人某件事。而这里某事就是由一个句字描述（thieves would try to steal the diamonds）充当tell的宾语，从句之前用一个that引导。当that不充当明确的句子成分时，可以省略不写。

举例：I think (that) you are right. 我认为你是对的。 You are right为宾语从句，它是think的宾语。

`When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield.`

连词`when`,`while`,`as`都可做为 ”当...时候“之意，但区别在于，while和as用于接**进行时态**，when没有限制，因此在写作时为避免出错可尽量使用when。

举例：While they were sleeping, a thief sneaked in. 当他们正在睡觉的时候，小偷悄悄进来了。
这个句字的while可替换为as或when

但换一种说法：They were sleeping, when a thief sneaked in. 这处只可用when连接。

## 语法

`She was reading a book at 11:00 last night.` 她昨晚11点正在读书
